## Build the Documentation site

The repository uses [Antora Playbook](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/) to combine and build the AsciiDoc content from multiple GitHub repositories into a static website.

### Prerequisites

#### git

You need git to get the source code of this repository. Run the command below to check whether git is installed on your machine.

```
git --version
```

If you don't have git installed on your machine, download and install it for your operating system from the [git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page.

#### Node.js

Antora requires an active long term support (LTS) release of Node.js. Run the command below to check if you have Node.js installed, and which version. This command should return an [active Node.js LTS version number](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)

```
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, install it, preferably via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### Clone the Playbook repository

Run the git command to clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/rancher/product-docs-playbook.git
```

This playbook repository uses a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to get the custom Antora supplemental files that provide custom GUI theme for the documentation website. Run the command below to get the submodule.

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Install node modules

Open a terminal at the root of the git repository. Run the command below.

```
npm ci
```

### Run Antora to build the static website

Run the command below.

```
npx antora --fetch product-docs-playbook-remote.yml
```

Navigate to the `./build/site` directory and open the index.html file in your browser to view and navigate the documentation site.

### Run Antora to build the static website using the local documentation content

The command provided in the previous section fetches documentation content of the products from their respective remote GitHub repositories. If you want the playbook to use the documentation content from your local machine instead, you can do so with `product-docs-playbook-local.yml`.

Clone all the individual product documentation GitHub repositories one level above the current playbook repository.

Run the command below to use the `product-docs-playbook-local.yml` file.

```
npx antora --fetch product-docs-playbook-local.yml
```

## Publish to GitHub Pages

The GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds the documentation using `product-docs-playbook-remote.yml` and pushes the built content to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/rancher/product-docs-playbook/tree/gh-pages) branch from which it is published on GitHub Pages.

The build job is run periodically, on push to the `main` branch of the repository, and can also be triggered manually from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rancher/product-docs-playbook/actions/workflows/publish.yml).
